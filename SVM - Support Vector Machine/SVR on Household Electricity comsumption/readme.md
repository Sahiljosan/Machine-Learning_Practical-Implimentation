## <font color=#00008B>Problem Statement</font>
To predict the individual household electricity consumption depending on the following attributes.
#### Attribute Information:
1. `date:` Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. `time:` time in format hh:mm:ss
3. `global_active_power:` household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. `global_reactive_power:` household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. `voltage:` minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. `global_intensity:` household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. `sub_metering_1:` energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).  It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered)
8. `sub_metering_2:` energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. `sub_metering_3:` energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
